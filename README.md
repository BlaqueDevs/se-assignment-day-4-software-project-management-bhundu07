# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
-helps work within the given budget.
-helps reduce overallocation of resources through working with the given resources for a project.
-adjust start and end dates for projects.
-can also identify longest path of planned activites so that you work to meet the deadline.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
-it helps to work within given time frames therefore working within  given resources.
-you can use key performance indicators like schedule variance which helps to calculate planned and actual process time. This helps to adjust time accordingly.
-and cost variance which helps to calculate the difference between actual cost and planned cost. This helps to adjust costs accordingly.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile:
-this is iterative and incremental meaning that a project is work from start to finish incrementaly.
-There is quicknes in responding to changes.
-there is also team collaboration.
-it is less predictable.
-and there is more customer involvement which may impede progress.

Waterfall:
-this is a linear and sequential process of software development where a projects is done in sequences or stages.
-there is clear structure and documentation of the project.
-it is also easy to manage.
-it is easy to accomodate changes with this methodology.
-and testing of the software happens and the last stage which may require more resources if the development did not go to plan.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
-Agile is ideal for dynamic environments and continuous improvement projects i.e developing a new website.
-Waterfall is preferable for projects with well-defined requirements and strict deadlines i.e construction of a building.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
-Capability maturity model integration (CMMI): asses maturity of business when it comes to quality assuarance.
-Then the goal is to train team members to push through the CMMI maturity stages until you develop a robust quality assurance process.
-maintaining high stardards mean that software developed meets customer needs and expectations.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
-scope helps to set boundaries.
-therefore having boundaries means software will be developed with those boundaries with the available and given resources.
-work breakdown structure is a visual, hierarchical and deliverable-oriented deconstruction of a project.
-work breakdown structure is important because it helps avoid issues such as missed deadlines, scope creep and cost overrun.
-It defines all the work that needs to be completed to achieve the project goals and objectives.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
-helps to conclude project within defined timelines.
-it also helps to have clear milestone to be achieved.
Gantt charts gives a visual representation of a project therefore developers will be able to see where they are with the project and how much to go.
-they also helps to see where resources need to allocated in developing software.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
-efficiency.
-speed.
-cost cutting.
-good user experince.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
-you will be in a better position to develop software that will effectively address that problem.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
-fast, scalable, reduces usage costs and has good user experience.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
-efficient
-good user experience
-fast

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
-helps in developing software that meets current trends.
-therefore the software developed will be able to positioned to meet the needs of the customers.
